Results of Large Non-Divisible Numbers
Introduction
This repository contains a set of numbers that have been generated under a unique mathematical property: these numbers do not divide by specific sets of prime numbers or their multiples (including products and powers). The primary purpose of sharing these results is to present a potential breakthrough in number generation that combines both deterministic results and randomness in its calculations, which may have significant implications for cryptography and other computational fields.

About the Numbers
Size: The numbers in this dataset are substantial, with lengths varying from several hundred thousand to millions of digits, providing a significant computational challenge for analysis and verification.
Non-Divisibility: Each number in the dataset does not divide by a specific set of prime numbers or any of their multiples, including their products and powers. The sets include:
Numbers that do not divide by the first 132,000 primes or any of their multiples.
Numbers that do not divide by the first 50,000 primes or any of their multiples.
Numbers that do not divide by the first 10,000 primes or any of their multiples.
Numbers that do not divide by the first 5,000 primes or any of their multiples.
Each file contains a different set of numbers, with varying lengths and prime divisibility constraints.

Direct Generation: These numbers were generated directly using a new method that combines deterministic outcomes with random components, ensuring that the numbers are not divisible by the specified primes, their multiples, or any of their powers without using traditional divisibility tests or predefined divisors.

Computational Efficiency: The results were generated using an average laptop with processing power that allows for fast computation. The numbers were produced in a very short time frame, ranging from a few seconds to a maximum of 1 minutes per 1000 number , depending on the length and complexity. This demonstrates the efficiency of the underlying algorithm.

Purpose: These results are shared as a proof of concept for a potential breakthrough in the generation of large numbers that exhibit certain non-divisibility properties. They may influence future research in number theory, cryptography, and computational mathematics.

Dataset
This repository contains the following files:

File 1(results132k): A set of numbers, each with a length of 800,000 digits, none of which are divisible by the first 132,000 prime numbers or any of their multiples.
File 2(results50k): A set of numbers, each with a length of 500,000 digits, none of which are divisible by the first 50,000 prime numbers or any of their multiples.
File 3(results10k): A set of numbers, each with a length of 60,000 digits, none of which are divisible by the first 10,000 prime numbers or any of their multiples.
File 4(results5k): A set of numbers, each with a length of 30,000 digits, none of which are divisible by the first 5,000 prime numbers or any of their multiples.
Each number has been rigorously verified to not be divisible by its corresponding set of primes or their multiples.

Verification Process
These numbers have been generated using a method that does not rely on traditional divisibility tests or pre-calculated divisors. Instead, a unique approach was used that blends deterministic and random elements to create numbers that adhere to the non-divisibility property. This ensures that the results are not reliant on conventional methods, but instead, are generated with a robust hybrid technique.

The verification process involved directly confirming that none of the numbers in the dataset are divisible by the designated primes or any of their multiples using optimized computational tools, which are able to handle the large scale of these numbers.

Research Context
The discovery of such numbers presents an opportunity to explore new avenues in computational mathematics, encryption, and random number generation. The non-divisibility property of these numbers suggests that they could have future applications in domains like:

Cryptography: Enhancing key generation, digital signatures, or random number generators.
Number Theory: Providing new insights into the behavior of large numbers and divisibility.
Computational Efficiency: Potential optimizations in computational processes that handle very large integers.
Disclaimer
No Full Explanation: The method of generating these numbers has not been disclosed to protect the underlying algorithm's integrity. The numbers presented here serve as a proof of concept.
Not for Direct Cryptographic Use: While these numbers exhibit unique properties, they are not intended for immediate use in production-level cryptographic systems. Further research and validation are necessary before any application.
Future Work
We aim to work with the academic and cryptographic communities to explore the implications of these numbers. We hope this repository sparks further research and collaboration, which could potentially lead to the development of more robust cryptographic systems or mathematical theories.
